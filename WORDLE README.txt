I approached the preparation for this Evaluation Test incorrectly.  In all of my spare time, I spent studying C# concepts
in Udemy.  Unfortunately, near the end one of my colleagues said that I should have been concentrating on the Coding
Challenges.  Due not spending time on the Coding Challenges as I should have, I have made my best effort to do what I 
could with this test.  I know that I could do better with some additonal mentoring.  However, the decision to allow for 
additional mentoring is in your hands.  Thank you for your consideration and for the time spent helping QA to make the
transition!  Daniel Jepsen
